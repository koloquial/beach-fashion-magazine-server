        "body": "The album opens with “Aurora’s Tide,” a lush and dreamy track that sets the tone perfectly. Soft guitar strums blend seamlessly with sparkling synths, creating an ethereal vibe that feels like sunrise on the water. The lyrics, “Meet me where the sky meets the tide, / Dreams are born and never hide,” immediately pull you into Starlight Serenade’s magical world.\n\n“Golden Drift” follows, and it’s the kind of feel-good anthem that begs to be played during a road trip to the beach. With an upbeat tempo, layered harmonies, and a chorus that feels like a warm hug, this track is pure joy. The instrumentation—a mix of ukuleles, tambourines, and a catchy bassline—gives it an irresistible sunny energy.\n\nThe album’s emotional core lies in “Lighthouse Heart,” a powerful ballad that showcases the band’s depth and vulnerability. Lead vocalist Elise Shore delivers a breathtaking performance, her voice carrying raw emotion as she sings, “I’ll be your light in the storm, / Guiding you when you’re lost and worn.” It’s a tear-jerker in the best way.\n\nFor a touch of playfulness, “Dancing in the Dunes” is an absolute delight. This track feels like a celebration, with upbeat percussion and lyrics about spontaneous moments of happiness. Close your eyes, and you’ll feel like you’re twirling barefoot under the stars."
