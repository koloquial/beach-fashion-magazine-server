    "author": "Sunny Starlette",
    "introduction": "Okay, besties, get ready to meet your new obsession: Layla Pearl. If you’ve been scrolling through beach pics on Insta and thought, “Who is this glowing goddess?”—it’s her. Layla is 18, lives in Malibu, and has a feed so flawless it looks like it was kissed by the sun itself. But guess what? She’s just as fun and down-to-earth as you and me. I got the chance to interview her, and OMG, you’re gonna love her as much as I do. Here’s how she keeps her glow game strong, her style on point, and her vibes absolutely radiant.",

        "question": "Sunny: Layla, your Insta feed is literal perfection. How do you always look so flawless at the beach?",
        "answer": "Layla: First of all, thank you! Honestly, it’s all about feeling good in your own skin. Like, I’m obsessed with glitter sunscreen—it’s SPF 50 and makes you sparkle like a mermaid. I always say, if you’re having fun, it shows in your photos. Plus, I never skip sunglasses. They’re my secret weapon for looking cool and avoiding squinting in every pic."
      },
      {
        "question": "Sunny: I need to talk about your style because…wow. How do you pick your beach looks?",
        "answer": "Layla: I like to mix vibes depending on my mood. One day I’ll go full Boho Babe with a crochet cover-up and shell anklets. The next, I’m channeling Neon Queen with a lime green bikini and chunky sandals. Accessories are EVERYTHING—I’m never without my layered necklaces and anklets."
      },
      {
        "question": "Sunny: Love that! Do you have any budget-friendly style tips for beach babes?",
        "answer": "Layla: Yes! Thrifting is a goldmine for unique cover-ups and vintage sunnies. Also, DIY your accessories. I make my own shell bracelets from stuff I find on the beach. It’s cheap, fun, and totally unique."
      },
      {
        "question": "Sunny: Okay, let’s get real… How do you stay confident in your pics?",
        "answer": "Layla: Confidence isn’t about looking perfect. It’s about having fun and embracing what makes you YOU. I used to feel shy about my freckles, but now I’ve learned to love them. Also, hype yourself up! I’ll literally say, “You’re a queen” to my reflection before a shoot. It works, trust me."
      },
      {
        "question": "Sunny: Any big plans for 2025?",
        "answer": "Layla: So many! I’m working on a sustainable swimwear line because I’m all about protecting the ocean. And I’m planning to travel to Bali and shoot some dreamy content there. Stay tuned—it’s going to be magical."
