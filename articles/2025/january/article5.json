Fans couldnâ€™t help but notice that her glittery lavender sarong looked strikingly similar to a design from indie creator Luna Driftwoodâ€™s latest line. Zaraâ€™s camp insists itâ€™s just a coincidence, but Lunaâ€™s followers are calling her out for not giving credit. What do you think, beach babes? Style snafu or shady behavior? (Psstâ€¦ Lunaâ€™s pieces are still on Etsy if you want the real deal!)"
