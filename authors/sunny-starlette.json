Writing for Beach Fashion Magazine is like a dream come true because I get to share my love for beachwear, confidence, and glitter sunscreen with YOU. When Iâ€™m not typing away, youâ€™ll find me hosting dance-offs on the sand, thrifting for vintage sunnies, or perfecting my one-leg pop pose (itâ€™s iconic, trust me).
