Growing up near the coast, Iâ€™ve always felt the ocean holds a little magic for anyone willing to listen. Writing for Beach Fashion Magazine lets me share my love for timeless style, dreamy dates, and creating memories that feel like they belong in a love letter. Whether Iâ€™m collecting shells or penning my next story, I believe life is best lived with a little nostalgia and a lot of heart. ðŸŒŠâœ¨"
